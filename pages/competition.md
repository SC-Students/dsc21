Below we will outline the competition in detail. Please see our SC page https://sc21.supercomputing.org/program/studentssc/data-science-competition/ for more information. Any updates to the rules or logistics will be shared on this page. All events occur in Central US time to reflect the time in the host city, St. Louis.

## Competition Logistics and Rules

### Phase 1 - Data selected by the SC21 Committee
#### October 30th - 31st

The first phase of the competition will be to approach the same mystery data set and general problem scope provided to the teams by the committee. This will be revealed at the start of the competition. Each team will be expected to derive some insights and present them to the judges. This phase will also allow teams to work through any hiccups in working on the cloud platform, teamwork, scale, time management, etc.

Students are allowed to work on Phase 1 from the kick-off event until 11:59pm Central US Time on October 31st.

### Phase 2 - Team-driven project 
#### November 6th - 7th

During the week between phases students will come up with a short proposal for an independent project, including the proposed data source(s), which will be approved by the committee before phase two. The second phase will have teams approach this independent project. Teams are encouraged to focus on problems relevant to St. Louis this year, but the categories they can explore are broad, ranging from areas such as education, climate or healthcare problems. This phase will be more intensive than Phase 1 and students will prepare a presentation that emcompasses everything from scoping the problem and relevant background, to their approach, and their final insights.

Students are allowed to work on Phase 2 from the kick-off until 11:59pm Central US time on November 6th. 

Prior to Phase 2, the proposal submission should include:
- A brief introduction and motivation for the problem to be addressed (2-5 sentences)
- Plan for data sourcing (links or 2-5 sentences/bullet points to describe)
