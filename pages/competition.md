Below we will outline the competition in detail. Please see our SC page https://sc21.supercomputing.org/program/studentssc/data-science-competition/ for more information. Any updates to the rules or logistics will be shared on this page. All events occur in Central US time to reflect the time in the host city, St. Louis.

## Competition Overview

### Phase 1 - Data selected by the SC21 Committee
#### October 30th - 31st

The first phase of the competition will be to approach the same mystery data set and general problem scope provided to the teams by the committee. This will be revealed at the start of the competition. Each team will be expected to derive some insights and present them to the judges. This phase will also allow teams to work through any hiccups in working on the cloud platform, teamwork, scale, time management, etc.

### Phase 2 - Team-driven project 
#### November 6th - 7th

During the week between phases students will come up with a short proposal for an independent project, including the proposed data source(s), which will be approved by the committee before phase two. The second phase will have teams approach this independent project. Teams are encouraged to focus on problems relevant to St. Louis this year, but the categories they can explore are broad, ranging from areas such as education, climate or healthcare problems. This phase will be more intensive than Phase 1 and students will prepare a presentation that emcompasses everything from scoping the problem and relevant background, to their approach, and their final insights.

## Competition Rules & Guidelines
These are guidelines and rules to help mentors and teams succeed during the competition. 

### General Rules
- Only accepted students can participate and log on to the Oracle Platform to work on the projects
- Teams must work within the Oracle platform for at least a portion of the time
- Working on your projects using the Oracle Platform cannot be done outside of the phase start and end times. The only project related work that should happen outside of the phases include:
  - Idea generation and creating the project proposal
  - Scoping and planning for the weekends
  - Initiating data sourcing as desired, locally to transfer later
  - Review of what happened in each Phase to summarize the work
  - There is no minimum time requirement for working on either Phase, however, we expect students will need to do some amount of work each day
  - A final presentation (5-10 minutes) of the results should be created by each team walking through their project(s) and results. Presentations should be recorded ahead of time in case of issues with presenting them live during judging. 
  - At least 1 team member should be present during judging

### Phase 1 Rules 
- Teams must complete Phase 1 to move into Phase 2
- The assigned dataset(s) must be used or analyzed in some way
- Additional datasets can be used to enhance the results, but are completely optional and not the focus of this phase
- Approaches and insights can vary and teams are encouraged to think creatively about this
- A final report of the project should be put on GitHub (https://github.com/SC-Students) or sent via e-mail to the organizers (kbrown@supercomputing.org) at the conclusion of Phase 1, containing:
  - Code, notebooks
  - A 1-page summary of the findings or results with or without figures in PDF format (this can be in the form of a final Jupyter notebook)

### Phase 2 Rules
- Project summaries should be submitted ahead of the start of the Phase for approval by your team mentor. Proposals should contain:
  - Short description (2-5 sentences) of problem to be solved and approach
  - Data set proposed to be used
- Once the team mentor approves the project, they should send it to the committee with the following confirmation
  - Approves the content of the proposed project as an interesting and/or impactful problem to solve
  - Confirms the dataset(s) chosen will help solve the problem or provide insight into the problem
  - Confirms the team has a generally good plan for approaching the problem and managing their time
- Projects should be unique in the problem being posed, the approach and/or the datasets being analyzed. Plagiarism will result in being disqualified from the competition
- A final report of the project should be put on GitHub (https://github.com/SC-Students) or sent via e-mail to the organizers (kbrown@supercomputing.org) at the conclusion of Phase 2, containing:
  - Code, notebooks
  - A 1-page summary of the findings or results with or without figures in PDF format (this can be in the form of a final Jupyter notebook)

### Mentor Guidelines
Mentors are experienced professionals that work with their team to make sure they are doing their best work and are able to fully participate in the competition. 

#### Mentors should
- Mentors should act as guidance to teams in giving broader feedback on projects in the following ways
  - Is this project / approach feasible in the given time / data? 
  - Should the team scope the project differently?
  - Feedback on slides
- Make sure teams are on track and getting the help they need from the committee or the Oracle team

#### Mentors should not
- Write or debug specific code
- Create the presentation themselves
- Define the entirety of the project or approach

### Team Guidelines
Teams consist of the 4-5 accepted students that work together to complete two projects during the competition.

#### Students should
- All team members should work on the project(s) as determined by each team. If a team member is unavailable for either phase, please let us know
- Set their schedule for each phase in a way that works for all members of the team and allows them to get their work done with enough breaks
- Create a private channel in Slack or group message to talk as a team during the competition easily and privately
- Ask questions on slack in the Students@SC #data-science-competition channel when having issues with Oracle
- Ask questions to the committee if having issues with any aspect of the competition 
- Meet with their mentor before and after each phase at a minimum to get feedback and plan for the next step

#### Additional recommendations
- Define roles for each team member and set expectations so everyone knows what they should be working on
- Rotate who is working or work in shifts that are planned out, swap out half days, etc
- Try to always have at least 2 people working at the same time, whether together on a video call or simply available to message on Slack, so that there is someone to bounce ideas off of or ask questions to
- Take breaks and get some sleep! It may be a long weekend of coding and data wrangling, but itâ€™s always useful to rest and approach things fresh
