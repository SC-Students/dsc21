This is a list of datasets, repositories, and search tools for your projects. Use this page as a starting point for picking the data appropriate for the questions you are trying to understand. It may take quite a bit of time to locate the exact data you'll need, so spend some time here going through the directly linked data, the lists, and the search tools to understand what's available and what is useful to you. Remember that you can work on a larger scale using Oracle and aren't limited to what fits on your individual computers!
